//What type of request is happening here and what packages are being used?

import axios from "axios";
import React from "react";

const baseURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1";

export default function App() {
  const [post, setPost] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    axios.get(baseURL).then((response) => {
      setPost(response.data);
    });
  }, []);

  if (!post) return null;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.body}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

//Here whats happening is that the code is performing an http get request using axios to fetch data from a specific url, utilizing react hocks useState and useEffect. the fetched data is stored in the post state variable.
