//Here’s an example node server that sends a 302 status code for <Redirect>s and regular HTML for other requests Please Explain how  <Redirect> works :

import http from "http";
import React from "react";
import ReactDOMServer from "react-dom/server";
import { StaticRouter } from "react-router";

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // This context object contains the results of the render const context - O;
  const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
    <StaticRouter location={req.url} context={context}>
      <App />
    </StaticRouter>
  );
  // context .url will contain the URL to redirect to if a «Redirects was used
  if (context.url) {
    res.writeHead(302, {
      Location: context.url,
    });
    res.end();
  } else {
    res.write(html);
    res.end();
  }
});
listen(3000);

//the <redirect> component from react router contributes to the StaticRouter component to hanDle redirects during ServerSide rendering. it captures the redirect url int he context object then sends the response with the 302 status code and redirects the url in the location header.
